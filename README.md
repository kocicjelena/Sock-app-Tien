Sockets

(http://gruntjs.com/) for build steps, so you need to:

- install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
- install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) using the command `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- run `grunt server` in the top-level directory of the app to test out on a local server.

This should automatically load the page in your browser. Instead of running `grunt server`, you can also try:

- running `grunt build` in the top-level directory of the app.
- run the Google AppEngine Launcher in the `dist/` directory that was created by the `grunt build` command
- open the page in your browser on `localhost`

- Live Reload, changes saved to your project will automatically reload the browser page if you're running `grunt server`.
